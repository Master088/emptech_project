            Contemporary art is the art of today, produced by artists who are
            living in the twenty-first century. As such, it reflects the complex
            issues that shape our diverse, global, and rapidly changing world.

            cultural identity, offer critiques of social and institutional
            structure or even attempt to redefine art itself.

            Fernando Amorsolo, a Filipino painter (1892-1972) was dominant in
            creating visual arts for decades before and after the second world
            war. He was popular for his artworks that was characterized by the
            scene of Filipino countryside, harmoniously composed and richly
            coloured, saturated with bright sunlight and populated by beautiful
            happy people. Amorsolo was committed to his two fundamental ideas in
            his arts which are; classical notion of idealism wherein truth was
            found through harmony, balance, and beauty. His second fundamental
            idea is the conservative concept of Filipino characters rooted in
            rural communities, and the cycle of village life. His artworks
            usually depicts people and barrio scenes in the Philippines.

            and the lifestyle of Filipino farmers.

            Created at the peak of Jackson Pollock’s career, Autumn Rhythm is a
            perfect example of the drip-painting technique. The technique, which
            is specific to Pollock, made him famous due to its originality. To
            create his works, Pollock stood on his canvas and dripped diluted
            paint onto the canvas, letting it fall naturally. He would drip,
            splash, scrape and pour paint onto his canvas. For the artist, the
            movement and paints themselves drove his art. This unique method of
            painting is considered to be the artist’s trademark. Ashley Ashley

            This painting sums up the Pop Art style of Keith Haring, with
            dynamic figures and a simple composition. From his beginnings as a
            graffiti artist on the New York subway, Keith Haring began his
            career with his immediately recognizable figures and patterns. One
            of his most commonly represented symbols is the heart. He used his
            work to popularize important messages about sexuality and AIDS
            during a time when the stigma and taboo surrounding these topics
            were still prevalent.

          <p class="text-center">
            British artist Cecily Brown is known for her luxurious and extremely
            textured contemporary artworks. Her art is a mix between that of the
            baroque masters and abstract expressionism. She mixes color and
            texture with sexually suggestive figures and biomorphic forms that
            stand out against the abstract swirls that dominate her paintings.
            By simply alluding to forms rather than offering a concrete
            representation, the artist forces the viewer to examine the
            paintings in depth, from which the erotic images come into focus.
